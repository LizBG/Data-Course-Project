# Data-Course-Project
This is a repository for my Data Course Project submission
It contains a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
And a the run_analysis.R in txt format under the name TidyData.txt
